## Charts to Make

Daily case fatality rate, trailing new Cases
7-day average of Deaths
7-day average of new cases 2 and three weeks prior


### Deaths Trailing Cases
_Scatter plot + 7-day average line_
* New deaths on a day / new cases two weeks ago (scatter)
* New deaths on a day / new cases three weeks ago (scatter)
* then do a 7-day average of those figures


## Hospitalization Fatality Rate
* New deaths / current hospitalization - 7 days

### Simulated Projections
* Need daily CFR (take average over last three months), then multiply by daily new cases in previous three weeks -> est. deaths for the next 3 weeks


## Other Todo
- Make Y-axis always start at 0
- Make CFR conform to global rolling averages


- Cumulative deaths vs. Cumulative hospitalizations
